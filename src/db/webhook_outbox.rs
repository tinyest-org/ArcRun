//! The dedicated webhook delivery QUEUE (`webhook_outbox`, Audit 2 D3).
//!
//! This is the at-least-once queue of end/cancel/batch_complete notifications: rows are
//! enqueued in the status-change transaction (outbox contract, Lot 2), claimed by lease,
//! and — the moment delivery terminates — DELETED here and historised into
//! `webhook_execution` as `success`/`exhausted`. Because a present row is by definition
//! awaiting delivery, this table has NO `status` column.
//!
//! `webhook_execution` (module [`super::webhook_execution`]) keeps two roles the queue
//! does not: the idempotency LEDGER of `start` deliveries (start_loop gate) and the
//! delivery LOG/history. The two tables are kept disjoint per idempotency_key by the
//! backstop `NOT EXISTS (ledger)` on enqueue and the DELETE-then-INSERT on terminal.
