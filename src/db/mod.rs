/// Execute a closure within a database transaction.
/// Automatically rolls back on error. Commits on success.
/// Callers must wrap their async block with `Box::pin(async move { ... })`.
///
/// # Cancel-safety (Audit 2, A1)
///
/// This delegates to diesel-async's [`AsyncConnection::transaction`], which
/// drives the connection's `AnsiTransactionManager`, instead of emitting raw
/// `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK` via `sql_query`. That distinction is what
/// makes the transaction safe against cancellation: if the surrounding future
/// is dropped mid-transaction (client disconnect, actix request timeout, a
/// `tokio::time::timeout`), the transaction manager records that the connection
/// is left inside an open transaction. bb8 inspects that manager state in
/// `is_broken` and discards the connection on return to the pool, instead of
/// handing it to the next borrower with a live transaction still holding row
/// locks (e.g. the batch `FOR UPDATE`). With the previous raw-SQL version the
/// manager was never updated, so a leaked open transaction could silently wrap
/// the next borrower's "autocommit" statements and a later `COMMIT` could make
/// a half-propagated transition durable.
///
/// Observable behavior for callers is unchanged: commit on `Ok`, rollback on
/// `Err`, and the same error is propagated. `DbError` implements
/// `From<diesel::result::Error>`, which `transaction` requires to surface
/// manager-level failures.
